# Nick Nguyen
Hi I am Nick, a final year Software Engineer student at Monash University. With a strong background in software development and a passion for creating efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications, I have had the privilege of working on a variety of projects that leverage cutting-edge technologies.

At Monash, I am involved in both research and development, where I collaborate with a talented team of engineers and researchers to build innovative solutions that drive progress and make an impact. My expertise spans across various domains, including web development, database management, and cloud computing.

I am particularly enthusiastic about open-source projects and enjoy contributing to the community. This repository is a reflection of my ongoing journey in the tech world, and I hope it serves as a useful resource for fellow developers and enthusiasts.

Feel free to explore the project, raise issues, and contribute. Let's build something great together!
